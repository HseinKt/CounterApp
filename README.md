# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Component-based architecture for modular UI design.
State management using React's useState hook.
Event handling for user interactions.
Fast development experience with Vite's dev server.
This project is beginner-friendly and serves as an excellent starting point for understanding React's fundamentals.
